# TFT_ILI9481-Dev.-Board
A simple developing board for a TFT screen based on ILI9481 graphic controller. 
I designed up this circuit to develop some libraries for this graphical controller.

This PCB was design using Allegro and OrCAD. It was my very first design using this software package.

Previously, I built a quick prototype in perforated board, but it resulted to be very unreliable so I decided to go a step further
and design the PCB.
