# TFT_ILI9481-Dev.-Board
A very simple developing board for a TFT screen based on ILI9481 graphical controller. 
I designed up this circuit to develop some libraries for this graphical controller.

This PCB was design using Allegro and OrCAD. It was my very design using this software package.

Previusly, I built a quick prototype in perforated board, but it resulted to be very unreliable so I decided to go a step further
and design the PCB.
